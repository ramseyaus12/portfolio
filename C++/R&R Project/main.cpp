An example of this is the implimentation of new antineutrino detectors in nuclear reactors, as well as the unique serial numbers found on every piece of the bomb that must match each other in order for the bomb to work." << endl;

The total death toll of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined was 194,000 lives.
